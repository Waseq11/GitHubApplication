Hello, This is a Mobile Application developed by me using C# Xamarin Forms. I used SQLite for DataBase. It was developed on Visual Studio 2022. 
It is an mobile application that uses the GitHub REST API
There is a Login page where you can log in or Sign up by creating an account
The Sign up page has a search bar where you can search up your github username and it will fetch your avatar image and fill the username box with your github username.
Then you can create an account with that.
After you log in,you can view tasks, edit or delete them.
Edit Task is a seperate page
I used many libraries
